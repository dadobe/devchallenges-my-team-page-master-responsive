<!-- ABOUT ME -->

## About Me

Hello there! I'm 'dadobe'.

Starting a new journey in WEB DEV. Trying to learn a bit everyday. Finally decided to put in practice what I've learned in the past months.

This is a simple example of a CREW MEMBER page that works RESPONSIVELY.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS)

### Editor Used

- [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Info

I mixed Flexbox and GRID in this example in order to get as a final result a responsive page.
The GRID class (you can see in the code) changes from a 2 x 3 picture disposal to a 3 x  [ rows x cols].

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?vfquery=serif&query=pop&preview.text=The%20creative%20crew&preview.text_type=custom) as well in order to match as best as possible with the example given.


## Features
